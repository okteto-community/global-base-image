# This okteto.yaml is used to build and push a global base image for HTML asset generation
# This image is NOT meant to be deployed - it only contains generated HTML assets
# Run this with: okteto build html-generator

build:
  html-generator:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.base
    target: html-generator
    image: registry.${OKTETO_DOMAIN}/${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}/workspace-html-generator:v1.0.0
    # This image contains generated HTML assets and will be pushed to the global registry
    # Other applications can use this image to copy the HTML assets (not for deployment)

# No deploy section - this base image is only for asset generation, not deployment
